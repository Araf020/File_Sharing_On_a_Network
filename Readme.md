Few GuideLines:
          1. Run server.java
          2. Run Client.java as many as you like(at least two instances)
          4. See the prompt on terminal or console
          5. Message Format: [(sms or fileName):(sms or fileType):(receiver)]
          e.g:
          5.1: to send a text message:
          hello bro:sms:client_1
          5.2: to send a file:
          send.png:png:client_1
